* bla.c 2019.11.11 Smythies
*       attempt to invoke OOM by asking for a rediculous amount of memory
*       see: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1188024/how-to-test-oom-killer-from-command-line
*       still do it slowly, in chunks, so it can be monitored.
*       However simplify the original testm.c, for this example.
*
* testm.cpp 2013.01.06 Smythies
*           added a couple more sleeps, in attempts to observe stuff on linux.
*
* testm.cpp 2010.12.14 Smythies
*           attempt to compile on Ubuntu Linux.
*
* testm.cpp 2009:03:18 Smythies
*           This is not the first edit, but I am just adding the history
*           header.
*           How much memory can this one program ask for and sucessfully get?
*           Done in two calls, to more accurately simulate the program I
*           and wondering about.
*           This edit is a simple change to print the total.
*           the sleep calls have changed (again) for MS C version 2008.
*           Now they are more like they used to be (getting annoying).
*                                                                     Smythies
